    <title>Dice game!</title>

        <h1>Welcome to Kurtis's Extravaganza Dice Roll Roundup Game </h1>
        <p>The aim is to be the first person to reach 100 points by rolling the dice as many times as you dare. Be careful though! if you roll a 1, your score resets to 0 and you'll have to start over again. To add insult to injury, you exit the game if you roll a 1 three times simulataneously!</p>
        <p>So how to win? Simply reach 100 points and avoid  those dastardly 1 rolls. Fear for your life? Press the hold button for the next player to have some rolls.

        <p>Please type the names of up to ten players.</p>
        </p>
